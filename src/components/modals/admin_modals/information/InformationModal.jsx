          <h5>RISKS</h5>
          <p>
            Regardless of whether Top-Notch retains ownership of the products, the
            risk in and to any products sold to the customer passes to the
            customer upon delivery at the delivery place. If the customer fails to
            take delivery of the products ordered or delays delivery in any way,
            the risk in the products passes to the customer immediately. When
            products are returned, the risk remains with the customer until
            Top-Notch receives the defective goods.
